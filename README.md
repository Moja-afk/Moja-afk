## Karibu! (Welcome)

I code primarily for challenges and learning but often forget to push :(. My latest goal is to utilize github more, and make as many useful
things as I can on my free time. Soon starting a youtube channel that I will link here.

I like reading, music, and League of Legends. For more about my scholastic and work related endevors, or to contact me, add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moja-williams-3aa577190/)
